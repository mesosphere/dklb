== Introduction

EdgeLB supports exposing Kubernetes services of type `LoadBalancer` via cloud providers' load-balancing solution. Service resources may be annotated so that `dklb` instructs EdgeLB to enable this feature for the respective pools.
As of this writing, only [AWS ELB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), and more specifically [NLB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html), is supported by EdgeLB, and therefore `dklb`.

== Instructions

=== Specifying the configuration for the cloud load-balancer

`dklb` must read the cloud load-balancer's configuration from a https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/[config map].
This config map must exist in the same Kubernetes namespace as the `Service` resource being exposed via a cloud load-balancer, and must obey the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  spec: |
    <spec>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: "<cloud-loadbalancer-configmap>"
----

In particular, it must have a key named `spec` containing the desired configuration for the cloud load-balancer.
Further details on `<spec>` are provided below.

=== Linking the configuration to the `Service` resource

In order for `dklb` to provision a cloud load-balancer for a given `Service` resource, said resource must be annotated with the following annotation:

[source,text]
----
kubernetes.dcos.io/cloud-loadbalancer-configmap: "<cloud-loadbalancer-configmap>"
----

When said annotation is specified for a `Service` resource, `dklb` creates a _dedicated_ EdgeLB pool for the `Service` resource.
This EdgeLB pool is called `ext--<cluster-name>--<namespace-name>--<service-name>`, and has a single instance, running on a private DC/OS agent.
[WARNING]
====
From this moment on, further customization of the EdgeLB pool via `kubernetes.dcos.io/edgelb-pool-*` annotations is ignored.
====

[WARNING]
====
The fact that `dklb` creates a new, dedicated EdgeLB pool means that any EdgeLB pool previously being used to expose the `Service` resource will be left untouched from the moment the annotation is specified.
The user is responsible for removing said EdgeLB pool _manually_ using the EdgeLB CLI.
====

==== Connecting to the cloud load-balancer

After the aforementioned annotation is specified, `dklb` will instruct EdgeLB to create a cloud load-balancer according to the provided configuration.
The hostname that should be used to connect to the cloud load-balancer will usually be reported shortly after in the `.status` field of the `Service` resource.

== Configuration

As mentioned above, the configuration for the cloud load-balancer must be specified via a config map that obeys the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
spec: |
 <spec>
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: "<cloud-loadbalancer-configmap>"
----

The actual contents of `<spec>` depend on the cloud provider being used and are defined by EdgeLB. Please, read EdgeLB pool configuration documentation for more detailed information.

=== AWS NLB

To configure an AWS NLB, `<spec>` must be a JSON object obeying the following structure:

[source,json]
----
{
  "aws": {
    "elb": [{
      "type": "NLB",
      "name": "<name>",
      "internal": <internal>,
      "subnets": [
        <subnet-1>,
        <subnet-2>,
        (...),
        <subnet-N>
      ],
      "listeners": [
        {
          "port": <service-port-1>,
          "linkFrontend": "<cluster-name>:<service-namespace>:<service-name>:<service-port-1>"
        },
        {
          "port": <service-port-2>,
          "linkFrontend": "<cluster-name>:<service-namespace>:<service-name>:<service-port-2>"
        },
        (...),
        {
          "port": <service-port-M>,
          "linkFrontend": "<cluster-name>:<service-namespace>:<service-name>:<service-port-M>"
        }
       ]
    }]
  }
}
----

In the snippet above, placeholders must be replaced according to the following table:

|===
|Placeholder |Meaning
|`<name>` |The desired name for the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html[Network Load-Balancer].
|`<internal>` |Boolean value (i.e. `true` or `false`) indicating whether the NLB should be exposed internally only.
|`<subnet-X>` |ID of a subnet which the NLB should join.
|`<service-port-X>` |The service port that should be exposed via the NLB.
|`<cluster-name>` |The name of the MKE cluster to which the current `Service` resource belongs, having any forward slashes replaced by dots.
|`<service-namespace>`  |The name of the Kubernetes namespace in which the current `Service` resorce exists.
|`<service-name>`|The name of the current `Service` resource.
|===

==== Example

To expose the `redis` service created in the previous example using AWS NLB, and assuming the name of the MKE cluster is `dev/kubernetes01`, the following config map may be used:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  spec: |
    {
        "aws": {
            "elb": [{
                "type": "NLB",
                "name": "redis-nlb",
                "internal": false,
                "subnets": [
                  "subnet-07a3022372ce71ad4"
                ],
                "listeners": [{
                  "port": 6379,
                  "linkFrontend": "dev.kubernetes01:default:redis:6379"
                }]
            }]
        }
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: redis-elb
